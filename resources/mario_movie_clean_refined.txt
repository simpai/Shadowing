Behold! The king of the Koopas!
Open the gates or die.
That is but a taste of our fury.
Do you yield?
I do not.
I've finally found it.
And now no one can stop me!
Uh, we're the Mario Brothers and plumbing's our game
We're not like the others who get all the fame
When your sink is in trouble, you can call us on the double
We're faster than the others
You'll be hooked on the brothers
- It's-a me, a-Mario.
And-a Luigi.
Are you-a tired of a-paying too much for plumbing?
That's why the Super Mario Brothers are here.
A-to save Brooklyn.
LUIGI: And-a Queens.
And-a your wallet.
Thank you, Super Mario Bros.
It seems like the only thing you haven't drained
is my bank account.
Forget-a the expensive a-plumbing companies
a-where you're just a face-a.
With-a Super Mario Brothers-a, you're family.
Hooked on the brothers, the brothers, the brothers.
- Oh, wow.
- - You were great. - I was great?
Are you kidding me? You were great!
I am so glad we spent our life savings on this commercial.
That is not a commercial.
That is cinema.
Uh, what about the accents? Is it... is it too much?
Too much-a? It's-a perfect.
Okay, I'm gonna trust you.
Well, well, well, if it isn't Brooklyn's favorite failures,
the Stupid Mario Brothers.
Ah, great. Spike's here.
Hey, Spike.
Yeah. "It's-a me!"
Whew, yeah.
Tell me, have you even gotten one call
since you left me to start your dumb company?
As a matter of fact, Spike, we have.
- - Wow. Really? - Uh, yeah.
Our mom called, and she said, "Oh, boys,
that's the best commercial I've ever seen."
And I said, "Thank you very much, Mother.
We're very proud of it."
- - So, boom!
Good luck running a business with this idiot.
Say that again about my brother,
and you're gonna regret it.
Oh, yeah?
Get this through your tiny brain, Mario.
You're a joke, and you always will be.
Are you insane? He's three times your size.
Luigi, come on.
You know, you can't be scared all the time.
Mm, you'd be surprised.
Hello. Super Mario Brothers.
A drip in your faucet? That's great!
I mean, that's-that's great you called us,
because we can be there and we can fix it right away. Okay.
- - Mario, we got one!
The Super Mario Brothers are in business!
Oh, no. We're gonna be late.
No, we're not. Come on, let's go.
Hey, wait up!
- This way.
Come on, Lu. Step on it.
- - WOMAN: Excuse you. - LUIGI: Here you go.
- -  No sleep till
- -  No sleep till Brooklyn - Oh, Mario, what are you doing?
Get off of there!
You can't be in... Whoa!
- - My bad! - Move it up!
Oh, I'm so s-sorry.
- - Hey, we're working here! - LUIGI: So sorry.
Come on, Luigi. Pump those legs.
Oh, I'm trying. I'm trying.
I got bad knees.
LUIGI: Oh, wow.
We have hit the big time.
The drip is right upstairs at the end of the hall.
- - Can you fix it? - Very confident, sir.
You'll be careful about making a mess?
Ma'am, I assure you, we don't make messes.
We fix 'em.
That's Francis.
He likes you.
Mama, mama, mama love ya, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
And a first job complete.
Francis is here.
Hey there, pal.
Mario, do something!
: Mamma mia!
Uh, Mario?
That hellhound is gonna escape!
No, he won't.
- - Hey, uh, Mario?
Uh, who's a good puppy?
Who's a good boy?
Found the problem.
ARTHUR: Ma, did you make these?
MOM: Ah, good batch, eh?
ARTHUR: Why don't you make it like this?
ALL: Hey-o!
BOTH: Hey-o!
Oh! It's the Super Mario Brothers, from the TV.
They give an Oscar for worst actors?
- What'd I do?
So, uh...
so everybody saw the commercial, then?
- - Uh-huh. We seen it.
I wouldn't quit your day job.
- - Oops! He already did.
Well, I thought it was incredible.
It belongs in a movie theater.
Ugh. Mushrooms?
Everybody loves mushrooms, right?
I like mushrooms.
- I'll take it. -: Yeah.
Mario, seriously,
what were you thinking with that commercial?
What? It's supposed to be funny.
Can someone pass the bread?
Yeah, but what's with the outfits?
Plumbers wearing white gloves?
That's right, you got to have a trademark.
Got to stand out.
Don't listen to them.
The world laughed at da Vinci, too.
Mm, I'm not sure they did, Ma.
Dad, what did you think?
I think you're nuts.
You don't leave a steady job for some crazy dream.
And the worst part?
You're bringing your brother down with you.
Well, thanks, Dad.
Thanks for your support.
- What'd I say?
Thanks for tuning in to News Channel 4.
Uh, you're not bringing me down.
You know what? What do they know, huh?
It's not just them.
Our whole lives, everyone's telling us
we can't do this, we can't do that.
I'm just sick and tired of feeling so small.
NEWSCASTER: A water main burst underground today,
stopping subway service and flooding Downtown Brooklyn.
Everything is under control, I promise you.
We are very close to fixing this.
- MAN: Out of the way!
- - MAN 2: Go back! - Somebody, help!
Somebody, save Brooklyn!
Save Brooklyn?
Luigi, this is our chance.
Destiny is calling.
Destiny Del Vecchio from high school?
What? No.
- - Just come on.
MAN: It's more than the storm drains can handle!
WOMAN: Come on! We got to pump it!
I got this.
They're not even looking in the right place.
Come on, Lu.
You are not seriously considering...
We got to get to that pressure valve.
Mamma mia.
I knew saving Brooklyn was a bad idea.
Come on.
What is this place?
Looks like nobody's been down here for years.
Luigi, are you in there?
Give me your hand!
It's all gonna be okay!
How is this gonna be okay?
I'm telling you, nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.
Do not touch that mushroom! You'll die!
Oh, I'm sorry. That one's perfectly fine.
That's a little mushroom man.
A little mushroom man talking to me.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Toad.
Uh, Mario.
So this is, uh... this is... this is not a dream?
- That hurt, right?
- Definitely not a dream.
Then it's... this place is...
The Mushroom Kingdom!
Mushrooms? Really?
Now, that is a cruel twist of fate.
Yeah, I'm actually looking for somebody.
Uh, my brother, in fact.
He looks exactly like me but tall and skinny and green.
See, last time I saw him, he... he was falling through a pipe.
It was foggy, and... and I believe there was lava.
Uh, that is not good.
: Um, your brother
has landed in the Dark Lands.
They're under...
: Bowser's control.
He's the most evil, wretched creature alive.
I'm taking you to see the princess.
She can help you.
She can do anything.
Come on, Mario!
Our big adventure begins now!
Hang on, Luigi.
Mario? Mario?
Where are you?
You just got a-Luigi'd.
This way, Mario.
The princess lives right on that hill.
Excuse me, everybody. Coming through.
Got a big adventure happening right now.
Just clear a path for us.
- - If I could just... - Here you go.
TOAD: Excuse me.
Excuse me, everybody! Coming through!
This guy's brother is going to die imminently!
Out of the way, please!
Just trying to clear a path. That's all I'm doing.
He's gonna be fine.
- - Nice to see you, bud.
Does this thing work?
Yes, works great.
You just have to blow into it.
And up we go.
Wait, up?
Whoa. Okay, so these bricks are just floating here? Uh...
TOAD: Just pop in this pipe, and we're on our way.
- - It's the only way to fly, man.
Oh, wow. Love these pi...
Oh, come on.
Here we are. Palace doors.
Bing, bang, boom.
Come on!
Pretty impressive, am I right?
Hold it right there, you two.
Oh, hey. I need to see the princess.
It's an emergency.
What princess?
I never heard of any princess.
Oh, wait, I did.
Our princess, though, is in another castle.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
You should try another castle, maybe.
She ain't in this one.
Okay, so they're messing with you,
and I don't like it.
What do you guys, um... What do you want to eat?
Anything... anything your hearts desire.
I am ready to scramble it up.
Hey! Intruder!
- - Stop him!
- - Stop him! - Stop him!
Now! Stop him!
Council, your attention.
Bowser has found the Super Star
and is headed toward our kingdom.
Its power will make him invincible.
We will be destroyed.
Princess, what are we gonna do?
I will not let him hurt you.
We are going to stop Bowser.
How? Look at us.
We're adorable.
I'm going to convince the great Kong army to help us.
Together, we'll annihilate that monster.
Their mad king doesn't make alliances.
The Kongs will never agree.
I can convince him.
I'll leave for the Jungle Kingdom in the morning.
Good luck, Princess, for all our sakes.
Princess. Hi...
Wait. Release him.
Are you...
He's a human!
I mean, you are a human, right?
It's just, you're so small and...
- Wait, wait, wait.
Let-let's go back. Where did you come from?
Uh, me and my little brother Luigi,
we-we fell down this pipe.
And now he's lost s-somewhere in the Dark Lands.
Then it's only a matter of time until he's captured by Bowser.
But you're in luck.
I'm on my way to stop him.
Well, take me with you.
This guy's a lunatic, a psycho.
He will eat you for breakfast.
He won't even notice it, probably,
'cause you're very, very small.
You know what? Make fun of me all you want,
but you are gonna help me find my brother.
Well, okay.
Let's see what you're made of.
Is that a yes?
No, that's a "let's see what you're made of."
If you can finish this, you're coming with me.
Watch and learn.
That was amazing.
Wait. How-how am I supposed to do that?
With the Power-Ups.
They give us special abilities.
Ugh. Really?
Go on. Eat it.
Now, this has to be a mushroom?
'Cause I just hate mushrooms and...
Okay, okay.
Are you sure there's not, like, a...
- - Down the hatch.
Yep, there it is, and all gone.
Oh, not cool.
- - I'm tall. - And strong.
And you can jump.
Oh, I got this.
No problem.
- Oh, yeah.
When you get hit, you lose the power.
Come on. Try again.
Where have all the good men gone?
And where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night, I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light
He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
Larger than life.
Well, we have a long journey ahead of us, Mustache.
- - But I didn't make it. - You almost did.
No one gets it right away.
How many tries did it take you?
: Oh, so many.
I was not good at it.
Worse than you.
You got it right away, didn't you?
I got it right away, but I grew up here.
Okay, now you're just trying to make me feel better.
No. No.
- - Is it working? - A little bit. Yeah.
My army!
- - Whatever those things are.
After years of searching for the Super Star,
- - it is finally ours!
I am now the most powerful turtle in the world!
Soon, we will arrive at the Mushroom Kingdom.
Where, after years of being sworn enemies,
I will ask their princess to marry me
in a fairy-tale wedding!
Did he say marry their princess?
KOOPA TROOPA: Doesn't she hate you?
Of course she hates me.
But that makes me love her all the more.
Her heart-shaped bangs,
the way she floats in the breeze,
her immovable tiara.
And when she sees this star...
: oh, wedding bells.
Well, what if she says no?
Then I will power up with this star
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!
Prepare yourselves for the best wedding ever.
It's gonna rock!
They're all counting on us.
No pressure.
My Toads, our days of terror are almost over.
With the help of the Kong army, we will stop...
Uh, who's he?
He's not important!
Who? Me?
- - Yes, a little.
TOAD: We're going on an adventure!
Come on, guys!
Hey, Mario.
You know this guy?
- We're best friends.
But are we?
Don't worry.
I will protect you.
A Toad brave enough to join me.
I fear nothing.
Well, that settles it.
You're coming with us.
- - Let's move.
I said we're going on an adventure!
Pretty incredible, huh?
Mamma mia.
PEACH: I'll never let anyone ruin this.
Peach, you're so cool
And with my star we're gonna rule
Peach, understand
I'm gonna love you till the very end
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
I love you
Peaches, Peaches...
A report from our intelligence.
A mustachioed human has arrived in the Mushroom Kingdom.
The princess has been training him.
They are up to something, sire.
Jam with me.
This, uh, human, where did he come from?
We... aren't sure.
Does the princess like him?
Oh, sire. Look in the mirror.
You have nothing to worry about.
I know that. I'm not threatened.
Find out who he is and what they're planning!
I'm on it, sire.
May I lift the cover?
Not yet.
- - Pain is the best teacher.
Thinking about your brother?
We've never been apart this long.
Don't worry. We're going to save him.
You don't seem like you're from here.
I don't know where I'm from.
My earliest memory is arriving.
PEACH: I was so lucky they found me.
They took me in.
Raised me like one of their own.
And when I was ready...
...they made me their princess.
Hey, maybe you're from my world.
There's a huge universe out there
with a lot of galaxies.
We found him in the Dark Lands.
Leave him to me.
What is your name?
Uh, Luigi.
Not sure if you know who I am,
but I'm about to marry a princess and rule the world.
Wow, uh...
But there's one problem, Luigi.
There's a human traveling with my fiancée.
Has a mustache, just like you.
Do you know him?
No. No.
Ah, a tough one, I see.
Maybe this will get you to talk.
LUIGI: Do you think I know
every human being with a mustache
wearing an identical outfit
with a hat with the letter of his first name on it?
- - Because I don't.
- - Do you know him?!
Stop, stop, stop, stop. I know him.
Yes, I know him. Yeah, he's my brother Mario,
and he's the best guy in the world.
Do princesses find him attractive?
They do if they have good taste!
Get him out of my sight!
We'll see how tough this Mario is
when he watches me kill his brother!
Where am I?
PENGUIN KING: Pay him no heed.
He is cute, but he is...
In an insane world, it is the sane who is called crazy.
How long you guys been in here?
Time, like hope, is an illusion.
Please! We are depressed enough!
There's got to be a way out of here.
There is no escape.
The only hope is the sweet relief of death.
PENGUIN KING: Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
You ready?
Eh... sure.
How you doing?
We are here to see the king.
Follow me.
That gorilla's wearing a sports coat.
Feel underdressed.
Hop in.
We're talking away...
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you shying away
I'll be coming for your love
Take on me
- -  Take on me
Take me on
- -  Take on me
I'll be gone
In a day or two
I'll be gone
- -  Take on me - In a day
Take me on
Take on me
- -  Take on me - Take on me.
Oh, by all means, come in.
Great and mighty Cranky Kong...
So, I heard you want my army.
Yes, Your Highness.
Without your help,
the Mushroom Kingdom will be annihilated.
What makes you think you're worthy of fighting alongside
the greatest army in the world?
Because we have heart.
And with your strength, we can win.
Okay, fine.
- - That's it? - No, that's not it.
The answer is no. Goodbye.
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls, the Jungle Kingdom is next.
We're not leaving without your army.
Who is this guy?
Oh, he makes me laugh.
All right, tough guy.
You want my army so badly, defeat my son
in the Great Ring of Kong!
Give us a second.
: This is a really, really bad idea.
Well, do you have another way to save my brother?
Are you two done whispering?
It's a little rude.
You, sir, have a deal.
I'll fight your son and win.
I'm sure you will.
Here, here, here, here we go
Donkey Kong
- - I am DK.
- - I'm Donkey Kong. - Donkey Kong...
- - Yeah! We love you!
DONKEY KONG: Oh, yeah.
Hi, Dad.
- No, no.
Don't do that.
Dad, wave back.
Enough with the showboating.
What do you mean? They like it.
It's what they came here for.
- - Dancing pecs.
Okay, simmer down.
Donkey Kong.
- - I said simmer down!
- - DIDDY KONG: DK! DK! DK! - That means you, Diddy Kong.
D... Sorry.
Now, since I want this fight to last more than five seconds,
I put Power-Ups around the arena.
You're welcome, Mario.
I don't need anything special to break
every bone in your tiny body!
All right.
- Oh, my... Okay.
Guess you're not getting my army.
Is this what you came for?
- We love you, DK!
DONKEY KONG: Hi, Dad! Love you!
It is on like Donkey Kong!
You're about to pick on someone your own size.
I guess he got the wrong mushroom.
Get up, Mario!
Had enough?
Not even close.
: It's-a me.
The box!
- - He looks adorable.
He really does.
Oh, what? I'm a cat?
You got the cat box! Oh, my...
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Okay. Now you die.
Huh. I'm a cat.
Had enough?
Not even...
I'll take that as a yes.
CROWD: Mario! Mario!
- - Yes! That's my best friend! - Mario! Mario!
Mario! Mario! Mario!
- - Yeah, yeah.
CROWD: Mario! Mario!
- That was incredible.
He kept beating you senseless...
...and you just kept getting back up?
You just don't know when to quit.
Well, never thought of that as a good thing.
It's a great thing.
Thanks. I...
I let him win, just for the record.
Really, though? Why would you do that?
You want to know why? It's...
Mind your own business! That's why!
All right, giant monkey.
Enough! Get inside.
We've located Bowser's ship.
He's gonna arrive at the Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.
Lucky for you guys, I got a shortcut.
We beat him there and ambush him.
Yeah, I know.
That's why we're gonna need karts.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Pick your karts.
- -  You've been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Ooh, thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck.
: I hate you.
To the Mushroom Kingdom
and the biggest fight of our lives.
Here we go!
Princess Peach, here we are.
I guess love really makes a guy come out of his shell.
Let's rule the world together forever.
Will you marry me?
Oh, yes!
We have found the princess and the mustachioed human.
He has defeated Donkey Kong and won the Kong army.
So, like, Peach was super impressed?
It appears so, yes.
They are heading toward their secret passage.
Oh, they think they can surprise me, huh?
Two can play at that game.
Um, no one panic, but the road is about to end.
Well, then you better step on the gas and buckle up!
Is there anything like this in your world?
: Is there anything like this
- - in your world?
We don't drive on rainbows.
What are you gonna tell me next?
That the turtles aren't evil?
No, no. They're usually pets.
No way.
Ah, come to Brooklyn. I'll buy you a turtle.
Maybe I will.
- Dude, is this you flirting?
This is painful.
Just-- I was trying to be nice.
You are so embarrassing.
A princess would never go out with you.
Yes, she would. I guarantee she would.
: Guys, enough.
All right, all right.
It's an ambush!
Defensive positions!
Mario, you're a dead man.
Split up!
I'm too cute to die!
That is how you princess!
Time to die, Mario.
- - See ya!
Woo-hoo!
You can't escape me.
Blue shell!
No, Mario.
Aah! No.
Get your clown claws off of me!
Goodbye, Mario.
We have to get home.
Hey, this is your fault!
- - My fault? You're the one who... - Stop talking!
I don't want the last thing I hear before I die
to be your...
Mario, you saved my life.
Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone.
Good. Please don't.
Uh, did you just feel something?
Bowser's on his way.
You have to evacuate.
Hurry. Get out of the city!
We lost the army.
- And Mario's gone.
Bowser is coming.
Head into the forest. I'll buy you some time.
You heard her. Evacuate the city.
Go with the others.
I said I wouldn't let anyone hurt you.
Just leave it. There's no time.
Princess Peach.
Brave as ever.
As you can see, I have the Super Star.
If you're going to use it, use it now.
No, Princess.
I stole this star for us.
I guess love really makes a guy come out of his shell.
I told you that line wouldn't work.
KAMEK: You're doing great.
Peaches, with this star, we will be invincible.
We can rule the world together forever.
Will you marry me?
Marry you?
Are you insane?
I would never marry you.
Maybe you should reconsider.
Please stop.
I'll... I'll-I'll marry you.
Just don't hurt my Toads.
You have my word.
Time for a wedding!
LUMALEE: Life is sad
Prison is sad
Life in prison is very, very sad.
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.
Who's this ray of sunshine?
There's no sunshine, only darkness.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hello, prisoners.
You don't deserve this,
but you're invited to the royal wedding!
Where you will all be ritualistically sacrificed!
Oh, no, no, no.
Finally, mercy.
So this is the end.
Being slowly digested by an eel,
next to an idiot in overalls.
Well, at least your brother isn't gonna die because of you.
At least you're not gonna die
with your dad thinking you're a joke.
Yeah, well, my dad thinks I'm a joke, too.
Yeah? Well...
your dad's right!
You know what? I feel bad enough.
Just-just leave me alone.
I've never met your dad, but he sounds brilliant.
Just go in a corner and smash some stuff, smash monkey!
I am more than a guy
who smashes things!
- - That was amazing! - Now we're even!
Princess, I got it.
Great job.
Couldn't have you going out there without your bouquet.
It's perfect.
I'll be sacrificing them in your honor.
Lower the prisoners!
Dearly belov...
You really thought I'd marry you?
I'd never marry a monster.
Then we are breaking up right now!
They got to be up there.
- - You want to do this? - Yes, I do.
Yes! Fire!
This is fun!
Ha! Loser!
Hey, what does this do?
- - Whoa. Yeah.
Cool raccoon suit.
- Not at all.
I told you. See?
As long as we're together, everything is gonna be okay.
Mario, why do you look like a bear? What is this?
You did good, kid.
Make your pecs dance. You deserve it.
No time now. Definitely later.
Launch the Bomber Bill
and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom!
Hey, hey. Hey, over here.
You asked for it.
Follow me.
Come on.
Little closer.
: Mamma mia!
- - That's beautiful. - You made these, right?
- - Huh? Whoa.
- - You almost dented my...
You want this?
You ruined my wedding!
I was finally gonna be happy!
- - Now you will suffer!
Like me!
You really thought you could stop me?
You worthless, weak little nothing.
Come out and fight!
Or are you too scared?
Just what I thought.
MARIO and LUIGI: Mamma mia!
That's why the Sup-Super Mario Brothers are here.
A-to save Brooklyn... save Brooklyn...
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.
Let's-a go.
Leave him alone.
You just don't know when to quit.
I've been told that before.
PEACH: The star!
No! That's mine!
Nothing can hurt us as long as we're together.
- - Rip them to pieces!
Oh, hey, Spike.
Mamma mia.
Uh, listen, this is not the way I pictured it,
but give me one more chance.
Ew, no.
No, no, no, no, n...
: Hey! Hey!
That is not cool!
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!
Eh? I told you I'd get you a pet turtle.
Not bad, Mustache.
And, Luigi, you're so brave.
Oh. Thanks, uh...
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.
Oh, my boys, my heroes!
Mario, you were amazing.
Thanks, Dad.
- - Ah, bring it in!
Let's hear it for the Super Mario Brothers!
These are my boys.
- -: H-Hey!
Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining
Everybody's in the play
And don't you know, it's a beautiful new day
- - Woo-hoo!
Now, that's a happy ending.
Or is it?
Because everything's over now,
and all that's left is you and the infinite void.
Kind of makes you want to play saxophone, huh?
Mario, Luigi and Donkey Kong, too
A thousand troops of Koopas couldn't keep me from you
Princess Peach
At the end of the line
I'll make you mine
Oh, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
I love you
Hey. Quiet in there.
Lights out, little guy.
: Hey! You can't treat me like this.
Do you know who I am?
- - I am Bow...
